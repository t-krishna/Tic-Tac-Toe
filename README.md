# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-2.0

Completed 10/24/2016 using Python 3.5.2
A better Tic-Tac-Toe with a better AI that uses the minimax algorithm to calculate all possible game states and choose the best move. This AI will never lose. It will only ever win or draw with the player.

The player can also choose if they want to be X or O. player X automatically goes first while player O goes second.
The cpu will take a relatively long time if it goes first because it is calculating the most game states in that initial turn.
